## Abstract
This repository contains the code and data for "BayesNet-ID," a comprehensive framework for network state identification in Online Social Networks (OSNs) and Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). The framework leverages Bayesian estimation techniques and incorporates a multi-objective cost-benefit analysis to address the unique challenges of these specialized networks.

---

## Introduction
Network state identification is a critical task in both OSNs and NIDS. Traditional methods have limitations, particularly in handling the stochastic nature of these networks. BayesNet-ID aims to fill this gap by offering a robust and versatile solution.

---

## Related Works
- **Network Tomography in Deterministic Environments**: Classical approaches have limitations when applied to more complex and dynamic environments like OSNs and NIDS.
- **Stochastic Routing and State Identification**: Existing methodologies often compromise on either scalability or accuracy.
- **Bayesian Estimation in Network Monitoring**: Bayesian techniques have shown promise but are not tailored for OSNs and NIDS.
- **Multi-Objective Optimization and Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Existing studies have yet to incorporate a multi-objective cost-benefit analysis.

---

## Methodology
The framework consists of several algorithms including:
- Bayesian Update
- Real-time Adaptation
- Cost-Benefit Analysis

---

## Experimental Setup
The experiments were conducted on various datasets including Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and YouTube for OSNs, and NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 for NIDS.

---

## Results
The framework outperformed six other existing frameworks on four key metrics: Accuracy, Network Load, Data Privacy, and Cost-Benefit Score.

---

## Discussion
The results indicate that BayesNet-ID offers a balanced trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and data privacy. It also scales well, making it suitable for real-world applications.

---

## Conclusions and Future Work
BayesNet-ID successfully addresses the challenges in network state identification for OSNs and NIDS. Future work will focus on further optimization and real-world deployment.
